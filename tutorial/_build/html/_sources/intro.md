## Why This Project Matters

Modern **materials science** is undergoing a **data revolution**. Thanks to advances in **high-throughput density functional theory (DFT)**, thousands of materials are simulated and characterized daily, resulting in **massive datasets** that hold the key to discovering new functional compounds.

However, extracting insights from these datasets is **not trivial**. That’s where tools like:

- **[Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)** → a comprehensive database with millions of computed materials properties.
- **[pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/)** → a Python library for analyzing structures and properties.
- **[ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)** → for interactive 3D visualization of atomic structures.
- **[matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/)** → for feature extraction, dataset access, and materials data mining.

help researchers, engineers, and students **accelerate materials discovery** for technologies like **semiconductors**, **photovoltaics**, **energy storage**, **catalysis**, **clean fuels**, and **batteries**.
